## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

CSS Grid Layout and more CSS styling tags.

### Continued development

I intend to continue honing my html and CSS skills. I don't know anything about JS but when I've fully mastered html and CSS, only then will I think of learning JS. I also intend to take on the Frontend mentor Bootcamp programming course once I finish all the free html and CSS challenge for newbies.


### Useful resources

-   [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This amazing site contains thorough documentation on all css styling tags. It also offers html and js tags.
-   [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - This is an amazing site for acquiring icons. You get to style and customize the icons however you like and it's just so amazing.
-   I'd like to recommend the MDN site or w3schools for anybody involved in programming. They are really great.
